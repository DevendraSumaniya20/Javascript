# Javascript

Basic Concepts for All Coding Languages & Where They Are Used
Variables & Data Types

Concept: Variables store data, and data types define the kind of data (e.g., numbers, text).
Used In: JavaScript, Python, Java, C++, C#, PHP, Swift
Operators

Concept: Symbols that perform operations on variables (e.g., +, -, \*, /).
Used In: JavaScript, Python, Java, C++, Ruby, Go
Control Flow (Conditionals - if/else, switch)

Concept: Determines which part of code runs based on conditions.
Used In: JavaScript, Python, Java, C++, C#, PHP, Swift, Ruby
Loops (for, while, do-while)

Concept: Repeats a block of code multiple times.
Used In: JavaScript, Python, Java, C++, PHP, C#, Swift, Kotlin
Functions (Methods)

Concept: Reusable blocks of code that perform a specific task.
Used In: JavaScript, Python, Java, C++, C#, PHP, Swift, Ruby
Arrays & Collections

Concept: Stores multiple values in a single variable.
Used In: JavaScript (Arrays), Python (Lists), Java (Arrays, Lists), C++ (Vectors), PHP (Arrays)
Objects & Classes (OOP - Object-Oriented Programming)

Concept: Code organization using objects and classes.
Used In: JavaScript, Python, Java, C++, C#, PHP, Swift
Asynchronous Programming (Callbacks, Promises, Async/Await)

Concept: Handles operations that take time, like API calls.
Used In: JavaScript, Python, Java, C#
Exception Handling (try, catch, finally, throw)

Concept: Manages errors gracefully to prevent program crashes.
Used In: JavaScript, Python, Java, C++, C#, PHP, Swift
File Handling (Read/Write Files)

Concept: Reads or writes data to external files.
Used In: Python, JavaScript (Node.js), Java, C++, C#, PHP
Database Connectivity (SQL, NoSQL)

Concept: Stores and retrieves data from databases.
Used In: JavaScript (MongoDB, MySQL), Python (SQLite, PostgreSQL), Java (MySQL, Oracle), PHP (MySQL)
Networking & API Handling (REST, GraphQL, WebSockets)

Concept: Communicates between different applications via HTTP requests.
Used In: JavaScript (Fetch, Axios), Python (Requests), Java (Spring Boot, Retrofit), PHP (cURL)
Memory Management (Garbage Collection, Manual Allocation)

Concept: Allocates and deallocates memory efficiently.
Used In: Java (Automatic), Python (Automatic), C++ (Manual), C (Manual), JavaScript (Automatic)
Multithreading & Concurrency

Concept: Executes multiple tasks simultaneously for better performance.
Used In: Java, C++, Python (Threading), JavaScript (Web Workers), C#
Version Control (Git, GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket)

Concept: Tracks code changes and collaborates with teams.
Used In: All programming languages
